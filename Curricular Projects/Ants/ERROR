When tests.py is run, I recieve the following error:

Fail: test_stun (__main__.TestProblem9)
...
	self.assertEqual('tunnel_0_3', bee.place.name, error_msg)
AssertionError: 'tunnel_0_3' != 'tunnel_0_4'
...






Looking into the tests.py file, it appears that this is caused by the bee not advancing when bee.action is called the second time

However

When I run each of the actions listed in the tests.py file manually, the tests all pass in that the bee does nothing the first call and advances the second call

I'm not sure what the problem is any help would be appreciated 

Thank you
