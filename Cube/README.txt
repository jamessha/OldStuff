PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
Using the Kinect's depth perception, we've created a virtual touchscreen that allows us to swipe up, down, left, and right to manipulate a Rubik's cube. Kinect work is done with Microsoft Visual Studio Express in C#; Rubik's cube work done in Python with the VPython library for graphics.

TO USE:
Open \Kinect2\WpfApplication1\bin\Debug\WpfApplication1 and open main.py and ensure the cube window is focused on. Enjoy.
