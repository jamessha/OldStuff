Whenever I run python scheme.py (python3 is installed as default python on my machine), I recieve two errors:

Error: length attempted on improper list
Error: length attempted on improper list

I have determined that this is due to the max and min function in scheme_primitives and due to the '.' used.

I am unsure as to where I went wrong in my code for this to occur. The build will run everything else (including Q10-12).
